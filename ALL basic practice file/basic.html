        <h5>What is Java API?</h5>
        Java defines the syntax and semantics of the Java programming language. This includes the basic vocabulary and
        rules used to write algorithms such as primitive data types, if/else blocks, loops, etc.

        APIs are important software components bundled with the Java Platform. These are pre-written Java programs that
        can plug and play existing functionality into your own code. For example, you could use Java APIs to get the
        date and time, perform mathematical operations, or manipulate text.

        Any Java application code written by a developer will typically combine new and pre-existing code from Java APIs
        and Java libraries.

        <h5>What is Java Virtual Machine?</h5>
        The Java Virtual Machine acts as an additional abstraction layer between the Java platform and the underlying
        machine hardware. Java source code can run only on those machines that have JVM installed on them. The answer to
        why the Java Virtual Machine is needed lies in the history of programming.

        <h5>The history of programming</h5>
        When natural programming languages were first developed, they fell into two broad categories, depending on how
        they communicated with the underlying hardware.

        Compilers: The complete program is written in natural English-like syntax with compilers, and the language then
        compiles (or translates) the entire code into machine code. The compiled code is then run on the hardware.
        Interpreters: With interpreters, every high-level code statement is interpreted into machine code on the fly.
        Written statements are run immediately by the hardware before looking at the next statement.
        <h5>The Java runtime environment</h5>
        The Java program was the first language to combine both methods above using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The
        Java code compiler is called the Java Virtual Machine. Any Java file is first compiled into bytecode. Java
        bytecode can only run in the JVM. The JVM then interprets the bytecode to run it on the underlying hardware
        platform. So if the application is running on a Windows machine, the JVM will interpret it for Windows. But if
        it is running on an open-source platform like Linux, the JVM will interpret it for Linux.

        <h2>JAVA2</h2>
        <h5>What is Java?</h5>
        Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

        It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

        <h5>It is used for?</h5>

        Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
        Desktop applications
        Web applications
        Web servers and application servers
        Games
        Database connection
        And much, much more!
        <h5>Why Use Java?</h5>
        Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
        It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
        It has a large demand in the current job market
        It is easy to learn and simple to use
        It is open-source and free
        It is secure, fast and powerful
        It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
        Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused,
        lowering development costs
        As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
        Get Started
        It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.
